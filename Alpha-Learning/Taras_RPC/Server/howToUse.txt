How to setup and use server side

step-1: copy your source code to your src folder 
step-2: in visual studio click on "show all files" (in project explorer)
step-3: you should see the files 
step-4: include files into project by right clicking them 
step-5: go to project properties, linker, input and add "rpcrt4.lib" into AdditionalDependencies
step-6: go to RPC_drone_interface.idl click properties go to MIDL click command line and add "/app_config" 


Use the code: 

step-1: include header file RPC_drone.h
step-2: create refference to header file (rpc_drone_s variable_name;)
step-3: call setup function in the begining of the progect(variable_name.RPC_setup();) 

be awere that this is running in while loop and code after that will not work.(use threads to solve this problem)
